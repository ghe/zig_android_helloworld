## Overview

This project showcases how to build a fully functional Android app using Zig for all core logic while maintaining Java as a minimal passthrough layer. The architecture strongly favors Zig over Java/Gradle, using the Zig build system for the entire APK compilation pipeline.

## Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Zig-first**: All application logic, UI creation, and business code written in Zig
- **Java passthrough**: Java layer serves only as an entry point, immediately delegating to native Zig code
- **Self-contained build**: Complete APK build pipeline implemented in `build.zig`
- **Memory safety**: Maintains Zig's memory safety guarantees while running on Android

### File Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ build.zig                  # Complete APK build system

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.zig              # JNI entry point and app initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.zig               # Core application logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui.zig                # UI creation and management via JNI

## Key Components

### 1. Build System (`build.zig`)
- Complete APK compilation pipeline
- Android SDK/NDK integration
- Prerequisites validation
- Resource compilation (layouts, strings)
- Java compilation and DEX generation
- APK packaging, alignment, and signing
- Health checks and deployment

### 2. Native Layer (`src/`)
- **main.zig**: JNI entry point that receives calls from Java
- **app.zig**: Application initialization and state management
- **ui.zig**: Dynamic UI creation using Android JNI APIs
- **ui.xml**: Layout definitions read by Zig code

### 3. Java Layer (`android/`)
- **MainActivity.java**: Minimal activity that immediately calls native code
- **Manifest.xml**: Standard Android app configuration

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Cross-compilation to Android ARM64
**Problem**: Zig's cross-compilation to `aarch64-linux-android` requires proper Android NDK integration.

**Solution**: 
- Created custom `android-libc.conf` with Android NDK paths
- Configured target query with ARM64 v8a feature set
- Added proper include and library search paths

```zig
const target_query = std.Target.Query{
    .cpu_arch = .aarch64,
    .os_tag = .linux,
    .abi = .android,
    .cpu_features_add = std.Target.aarch64.featureSet(&.{.v8a}),
};
```

### Challenge 2: Missing `getauxval` Symbol (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Android's runtime couldn't resolve the `getauxval` symbol required by Zig's stack protection, causing library loading failures:
```
UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "getauxval"
```

**Root Cause**: API level mismatch - targeting Android API 21 while device runs API 35.

**Solution**: 
- Updated target API level from 21 to 35 to match device
- Modified `android-libc.conf` to use API 35 libraries
- Added proper API 35 library search paths
- **No workaround code needed** - proper NDK integration resolved the issue

```zig
// Proper Android NDK API 35 integration
const api_35_lib_path = b.fmt("{s}/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-android/35", .{android_config.ndk_path});
lib.addLibraryPath(.{ .cwd_relative = api_35_lib_path });
lib.linkSystemLibrary("c"); // Now properly resolves getauxval from Android libc
```

### Challenge 3: JNI Header Discovery
**Problem**: Zig's C import system couldn't find Android's `jni.h` headers during compilation.

**Solution**:
- Added Android NDK include directories to build configuration
- Used `lib.addIncludePath()` to expose JNI headers to `@cImport`

### Challenge 4: JNI Function Pointer Syntax
**Problem**: Zig's JNI function call syntax required double pointer dereferencing:
```zig
// Wrong: env.*.FindClass.?() 
// Right: env.*.*.FindClass.?()
```

**Solution**:
- Updated all JNI calls to use proper double dereferencing syntax
- Added comprehensive error checking and Android logging

### Challenge 5: Dynamic UI Creation
**Problem**: Creating Android UI components entirely from Zig without XML inflation.

**Solution**:
- Implemented JNI-based TextView creation in `ui.zig`
- Used Android's reflection APIs to call Java methods from Zig
- Demonstrates programmatic UI construction with proper memory management

## Build Requirements

- Zig (latest)
- Android SDK (API 24+)
- Android NDK (r25+)
- Java 8+
- Android device or emulator

## Environment Setup

```bash
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android-sdk
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=/opt/android-ndk
```

## Building

```bash
# Build and install APK
zig build deploy

# Or step by step:
zig build check    # Verify prerequisites
zig build lib      # Build native library  
zig build java     # Compile Java sources
zig build dex      # Create DEX bytecode
zig build apk      # Package APK
zig build sign     # Sign APK
zig build test     # Run health checks
```

## Testing

```bash
# Install and launch
adb install -r build/helloworld.apk
adb shell am start -n com.zig.helloworld/.MainActivity

# Monitor logs
adb logcat -s ZigHelloWorld
```

## Key Innovations

1. **Complete Zig Build System**: Entire APK compilation pipeline implemented in Zig, eliminating Gradle dependency

2. **Minimal Java Footprint**: Java serves only as entry point, with immediate delegation to Zig

3. **Native UI Creation**: UI components created directly from Zig using JNI, not XML inflation

4. **Memory Safety Preserved**: Maintains Zig's memory safety guarantees in Android environment

5. **Custom libc Integration**: Solved Android-specific libc compatibility issues while preserving stack protection

## Performance Benefits

- **Faster Compilation**: Direct compilation without Gradle overhead
- **Smaller Binary Size**: Minimal Java bytecode, optimized native code
- **Memory Efficiency**: Zig's memory management reduces allocation overhead
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent common Android memory issues

## Future Enhancements

- XML layout parsing and inflation from Zig
- Complete Android API bindings for Zig
- Integration with Android's Build Tools Plugin API
- Support for additional architectures (x86_64, ARM32)
- Resource bundling and asset management
- Automated testing framework integration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Android NDK Integration**: Proper libc configuration is critical for cross-compilation success
2. **JNI Complexity**: Direct JNI usage requires careful memory management and error handling  
3. **Build System Benefits**: Custom build systems provide better control and understanding
4. **Compatibility Layers**: Sometimes small compatibility shims (like getauxval_stub.c) are necessary
5. **Debugging Strategy**: Comprehensive logging at each layer aids troubleshooting

This project demonstrates that Zig can be successfully used as the primary language for Android development, providing memory safety, performance benefits, and a more direct development experience than traditional Java/Kotlin approaches.
